## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to my **personal portfolio website repository**.

This site is built using **GitHub Pages** and represents:
- who I am  
- what I build  
- how I apply data science concepts in real projects  

Instead of just saying *“I know Data Science”*,  
this portfolio **shows my work, code, and thinking**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Portfolio

I built this portfolio to:

✅ Go beyond a traditional resume  
✅ Showcase **real, hands-on projects**  
✅ Share my learning journey publicly
